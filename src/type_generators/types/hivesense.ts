     *
     *     Key features:
     *     - Semantic analysis considers post content and context
     *     - Results are ordered by similarity (most similar first)
     *     - Optional content filtering through observer blacklists
     *     - Configurable body length truncation for preview purposes
     *     - Split response: full data for top results, stubs for remainder
     *
     *     The similarity analysis takes into account:
     *     - Post content and context
     *     - Semantic relationships between posts
     *     - Topic relevance and contextual meaning

     * Fetch full post details for multiple posts by their IDs
     * @description Retrieves complete post information for a batch of posts identified by

     *     new paging model where search results return mostly stub entries, and
     *     clients fetch full details as needed for display.
     *
     *     Key features:
     *     - Accepts up to 50 post identifiers in a single request
     *     - Returns posts in the same order as requested
     *     - Supports body truncation for preview mode
     *     - Respects observer mute lists and blacklists
     *     - Returns null for non-existent posts while preserving order
     *
     *     This endpoint is typically used after calling /posts/search or
     *     /posts/{author}/{permlink}/similar, which return full data for only
     *     the first N posts. When the user scrolls or pages through results,
     *     the client calls this endpoint with the next batch of author/permlink
     *     pairs to get their full details.
     *
     *     Example workflow:
     *     1. Call /posts/search with result_limit=1000, full_posts=10
     *     2. Display first 10 posts immediately (already have full data)
     *     3. When user scrolls to post 11, call this endpoint with posts 11-20
     *     4. Continue fetching batches as user scrolls
